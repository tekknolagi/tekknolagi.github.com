Stickers page has been removed because StickerMule no longer has custom sticker
sales but this page remains to avoid link rot. If you can recommend me a
similar sticker store, I can put some of the designs back up.

It looks like Zazzle (which I have been using to [make
t-shirts](https://www.zazzle.com/compiler_ampersand_2_t_shirt-235252907121889789))
also supports stickers, so perhaps I will investigate that.
