<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I [tweet
things](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi) about bread, legumes, and compilers.
Though my official title is Chief Potato, I work at Instagram as a software
engineer.

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* An in-progress [Lisp to x86-64 compiler](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum)
  I am writing in C and [writing about](/blog/lisp/) on my blog
* [EXP 57](/excollege/), a course on professional and personal development that
  I taught at Tufts University with [Yuki](https://yzan424.github.io/)
* The [term paper](/dat-paper/) I wrote for COMP 117 IDS
  analyzing Dat and the Beaker browser
* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/), a compiler front-end and toolchain for
  OCaml
* An [automatically distributed programming language](https://github.com/tekknolagi/distlisp)
  (2016) for my networks course, with the
  [final writeup [PDF]](/resources/comp112-writeup.pdf)
* The [final project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf)
  and reference implementation (2016) and
  [independent project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-independent.pdf)
  (2016) for the data structures course I TA'ed
* A [distributed ray tracer](https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer) (2015) that I
  made with friends for a concurrent programming course, with the
  [final writeup [PDF]](/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf)
* An unexpectedly popular [virtual machine](https://github.com/tekknolagi/carp)
  (2014) that got some Hacker News attention, along with its newer
  and much better designed [cousin](https://github.com/RabbitVM/rabbit) (2016)

## I kind of maintain a blog.

<del>It's not very interesting just yet.</del> [Things are happening.](/blog/)

## Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.
* [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  ([rC345558](https://reviews.llvm.org/rC345558))
* [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/)
  ([Refactor protocol inference](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/commit/f14577db5940c0b4087fffe209786cd4075f37df))
* [CPython](https://www.python.org/)
  ([bpo-36929](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13392),
  [bpo-38648](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17002),
  [bpo-42065](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/19940),
  [bpo-42199](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23031))
* [Shopify's Ruby fork](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby)
  ([#58](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/58))
