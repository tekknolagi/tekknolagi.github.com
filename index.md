# I'm Max Bernstein.

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos, and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I [tweet
things](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi) (and [toot
things](https://mastodon.social/@tekknolagi)) about bread, legumes, and
compilers. I did a half-batch of [Recurse Center]({{site.rc_scout}}) (Fall 2
2024) and really enjoyed it.

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* The [National Malware Association](https://nationalmalware.org/), an
  organization focused on security and education
* [scrapscript.py](https://github.com/tekknolagi/scrapscript), an
  implementation of the Scrapscript language. Check out the [blog](/blog/scrapscript/)
  [posts](/blog/scrapscript-baseline/) (and [three](/blog/scrapscript-tricks/),
  [four](/blog/type-inference/), [five](/blog/row-poly/)) too
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), Instagram's
  performance-oriented fork of CPython---try it out on
  [trycinder.com](https://trycinder.com) (which I built!)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison) (fork of
  [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison)), Instagram's
  performance-oriented greenfield implementation of Python
* [shru.gg](https://shru.gg), a website built just so I would have to stop
  finding, copying, and pasting that shrug emoji. If you like it, you are
  welcome [to help keep it running](https://github.com/sponsors/tekknolagi)

and some [older projects](/older-projects/).

I like making things [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/).

## I like teaching.

* I taught [CS 4973: ISDT](/isdt/) (2024) at Northeastern
* I taught [CS 50ISDT](/isdt/) (2021) with Tom Hebb at Tufts
* I taught [EXP 57](/excollege/) (2018) with Yuki Zaninovich at Tufts

[Tom](https://tchebb.me/) and I wrote *Introduction to Software Development
Tooling* (ISDT) originally for Tufts (as CS 50 ISDT), and then made some
modifications to teach it at Northeastern (as CS 4973 ISDT).

[Yuki](https://yzan424.github.io/) and I wrote *EXP 57: Tech Trends and
Careers* for the Experimental College at Tufts University to teach students
about personal and professional development. In 2021, we taught a
much-condensed version of it as a multi-day workshop at Tufts.

* I TAed CS 4530 at Northeastern (Fall 2023)
* I TAed CS 11 (intro), 15 (data structures), 40 (machine structure), and
  Concurrent Programming at Tufts and was the head TA for 11 and 15

I also worked at the Center for Education Research at Stanford (CERAS) in 2014
and taught robotics at a summer camp some time between 2013 and 2018.

## Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.

* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/)
  ([!848](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/merge_requests/848),
  [!858](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/merge_requests/858))
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison)
  (fork of [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison))
* [YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby)
  ([#58](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/58),
   [#59](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/59)),
  which now lives in [upstream Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
* [CPython](https://www.python.org/)
  ([bpo-36929](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13392),
  [bpo-38648](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17002),
  [bpo-42065](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/19940),
  [bpo-42199](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23031),
  [faster-cpython #546](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/546))
* [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/)
  ([Refactor protocol inference](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/commit/f14577db5940c0b4087fffe209786cd4075f37df))
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  ([rC345558](https://reviews.llvm.org/rC345558))
* [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason)

Fun fact: I have now contributed to five different Python runtimes (Skybison,
Cinder, CPython, PyPy, and Pyjion).

## I like writing.

I have a blog and now I also have some academic papers!

* *Partial Evaluation, Whole-Program Compilation* (preprint; do not distribute) \
  Chris Fallin, **Maxwell Bernstein** \
  [[PDF](/assets/img/wasm-partial-eval.pdf)] [[ARX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10559)]
* *Dr Wenowdis: Specializing dynamic language C extensions using type information* (2024) \
  **Maxwell Bernstein**, CF Bolz-Tereick \
  in PLDI SOAP 2024 \
  [[PDF](/assets/img/dr-wenowdis.pdf)] [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3652588.3663316)] [[ARX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02420)]

## I will happily talk in front of people.

* Invited guest lecture for Dartmouth [CS 59](https://cosc59.gitlab.io/) on dynamic language runtimes at scale, November 2024
* [*Dr Wenowdis: Specializing dynamic language C extensions using type information*](/assets/img/dr-wenowdis-slides.pdf) (PDF) at PLDI SOAP 2024

* [*Cinder: We didn't start the fire*](/assets/img/ecoop2022.pdf) (PDF) at [ECOOP 2022](https://2022.ecoop.org/details/ICOOOLPS-2022-papers/5/Cinder-We-didn-t-start-the-fire) (invited talk)
* *How Git works* at Tufts PolyHack 2019

## I have some fun facts.

* I [adopted the Person Biking emoji ðŸš´](https://twitter.com/unicode/status/1341803011501223936).
* I once biked across Germany (TÃ¼bingen to Puttgarden).
* I walked the entire [Walking City Trail](https://www.bostontrails.org/) in
  one day. It took 10 hours of moving time and 2 hours of eating time.
* I used to sell bread on the Internet.
