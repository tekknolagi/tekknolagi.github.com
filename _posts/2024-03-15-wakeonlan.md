title: Waking my computer from afar
description: "I write a small web application on a small device to remotely wake up my desktop computer."
---

I have a desktop computer at home with a decent CPU and GPU and RAM and all
that. I use it when I need to do Beefy Processing Things like compiling LLVM or
when I want to save battery on my laptop. I like leaving it in hibernation mode
to save power, but sometimes I forget to wake it up on a day that I might need
it from the library or something. For that, I need to be able to wake it up
remotely.

## wakeonlan

Fortunately, some smart folks thought of this years ago and came up with [Wake
on LAN][wol]. There are tools such as [etherwake][etherwake] and
[wakeonlan][wakeonlan] that can send a magic packet to the computer's
network controller and wake up a sleeping machine. That's fantastic, except:

[wol]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN
[etherwake]: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/etherwake
[wakeonlan]: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wakeonlan

* Sometimes I leave the house, which (because of NAT) means I cannot easily
  send the computer a packet. I could probably find a way to get my router to
  notice the packet coming from WAN and forward it appropriately, but...
  eh[^assistant].
* I could probably SSH into my router and send the appropriate packet, but
  installing tools on my router, even though it's running OpenWRT, is kind of
  irritating.

[^assistant]: I just remembered as I wrote this that in college we also
    configured a voice assistant to, when prompted with some key phrase, send
    an HTTP request to our router, which would then send a WoL packet to our
    media server. That was pretty useful.

So I need to find a way to get the packet to *come from inside the house* and
not from my router. Sounds like a great excuse to buy a low-power computer and
use that as a bastion host. I decided to buy a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, but
that's because it was reasonably priced and available with a short walk.

## A very small server

After some nonsense[^pi-setup] setting up the Pi, I managed to SSH into it and
send a WoL packet. Nice! But I also have to be able to access the SSH server
from outside the house. Instead of setting up port forwarding or OpenVPN on my
router, I added the Pi to my Tailscale network (no, this is not an ad; just
happy), which was pretty painless.

```console
cedar% ssh raspberrypi
max@raspberrypi:~ $ wakeonlan MY:MA:CA:DD:RE:SS
max@raspberrypi:~ $ ^D
cedar%
```

[^pi-setup]: I don't know why, but getting my Pi to post took about 6 hours of
    troubleshooting. It was made more difficult because I didn't have any USB
    OTG cables or mini HDMI cables, so I was very in the dark---I only knew if
    it came online if it joined the WiFi network and acquired a DHCP lease.
    What I learned eventually is:

    * My Pi only supports 2.4GHz, not 5GHz
    * The 64 bit Raspberry Pi OS images, lite or otherwise, are trouble; 32 bit
      seems to work okay
    * The image does not come with user accounts or SSH enabled and that needs
      to be manually enabled using some funky half-documented first-boot
      configuration
    * Older versions of the official imaging tool provided by Raspberry Pi
      simply do NOT work and I might have been better off using `dd`

    But it's fine. It works now. I only wasted a lot of time on Pi Day, of all
    days.

Then I remembered some of our old [college apartment
infrastructure](/blog/how-to-mess-with-your-roommate/) and realized I should
probably have a webpage as well. It would be neat to be able to open a page on
my laptop or phone and wake my desktop from its slumber.

<img src="/assets/img/wakemeup-desktop.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 80%;" alt="The very large buttons saying 'WAKE ME UP (wake me up inside)' and 'Go to sleep'" />

Because I wanted to write as little code and infrastructure as possible, this
is served via [Busybox httpd][httpd].

```console?prompt=$
$ /usr/bin/busybox httpd -vv -p 80 -c /home/max/httpd.conf -f
...
```

The configuration file just sets `index.html` as the default directory index
page and sets the root directory.

When I click one of the buttons, it sends a request to---yes, you guessed
it---a CGI handler. It's very small, and could even be smaller if I didn't log
error output. For example, here is the wake handler:

[httpd]: https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/webserver/http.httpd

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
print("Content-Type: text/html")
print()
result = subprocess.run(["wakeonlan", "MY:MA:CA:DD:RE:SS"], capture_output=True)
if result.returncode != 0:
    print("<pre>")
    print("stderr:", result.stderr.decode('utf-8'))
    print("stdout:", result.stdout.decode('utf-8'))
    print("</pre>")
else:
    print("He has risen")
```

Because I didn't want to have to hit the back button and also vaguely
remembered an interesting snippet of code I saw on lobste.rs recently, I
decided to use [HTMZ][htmz] to inject this CGI-printed response into the
original page[^repeated].

[htmz]: https://leanrada.com/htmz/

[^repeated]: It doesn't really make sense for this project, but I learned while
    poking around on the HTMZ page that a browser won't make repeated GET
    requests from an iframe. Fortunately, there is a very slightly [different
    version of HTMZ](https://leanrada.com/htmz/extensions/) for that.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <form target=htmz>
      <button formaction="/cgi-bin/wake.cgi#wake-response">WAKE ME UP (wake me up inside)</button>
      <button formaction="/cgi-bin/sleep.cgi#wake-response">Go to sleep</button>
    </form>
    <div id="wake-response"></div>
    <iframe hidden name=htmz onload="setTimeout(()=>document.querySelector(contentWindow.location.hash||null)?.replaceWith(...contentDocument.body.childNodes))"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

This means that when I click the "WAKE ME UP" button, I see what happened right
beneath the buttons. And I didn't even have to write any JS or do any
presentation logic inside the CGI handler; the HTMZ handled it for me using the
hash link in the `formaction`.

## Systems administration

Because I want this server to come up without any manual intervention, I set up
a systemd service for it. Instead of fiddling around with the services in
`/etc` that require root, I instead made a user service. This means that the
service only has my privileges and I don't need to use `sudo`.

I put the `wake.service` file (below) into `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/wake.service` and ran:

1. `loginctl enable-linger max` to allow my user to run long-running services
   without staying logged in
1. `systemctl --user enable wake` to enable the service
1. `systemctl --user start wake` to start it up

You might have to also do `systemctl --user daemon-reload` to get systemd to
reload the service from disk or something, but I am not clear on that.

```ini
# The service
[Unit]
Description=Wake

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/busybox httpd -vv -p 80 -c /home/max/httpd.conf -f
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This is great. It means that I can enable it once and forget about it, even
across restarts. I don't even need to touch the service if I edit the CGI,
since it's loaded from disk on every request. I think I only need to touch the
systemd service if I want to change the httpd configuration.

Now, you might be wondering to yourself "Max, you said you weren't running as
root. How are you binding to port 80?" Well, `sudo setcap
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/bin/busybox`. But you could also run on an
unprivileged port like 8080.

This was probably the last dose of systems administration that I'll need for
the next six years or so. See you all soon for some more programming languages
or breadposting.

## Sleep on LAN

**Update on March 27, 2024:** I found
[sleep-on-lan](https://github.com/SR-G/sleep-on-lan), which I can run on the
desktop machine and it will make the computer *sleep* when it receives a magic
packet. It does this by waiting for the same magic packet but to the *reversed*
MAC address. I set that up as an unprivileged user service on the big desktop
and now the "Sleep" button actually works.

**Update on June 24, 2025:** A long time ago, someone (unfortunately I don't
remember who) told me that I can do wakeonlan [from
Python](https://github.com/remcohaszing/pywakeonlan/blob/main/wakeonlan/__init__.py)
and skip the subprocess. An even lower code solution. Amazing.

## All the code
