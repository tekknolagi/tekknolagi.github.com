I recently changed my primary laptop, and actually my development flow with it. I'm programming (and writing this article) on the [Acer Aspire One](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-AOD150-1165-10-1-Inch-Sapphire-Blue/dp/B001QFZFS0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350408431&sr=8-1&keywords=acer+aspire+one+10.1), a pretty slick little netbook. It has a 10.1" screen, relatively cramped keyboard, and okay battery life.

The 10.1 inch screen is not a problem; it's actually really nice to have a laptop smaller than my paper notebook. The keyboard, on the other hand, took some getting used to; I have rather large hands and I need to crunch them together to type. Not a huge impediment, though.

The battery life is strange; it declines in a linear fashion from 100%, then somewhere around 45% it drops to 5%. That's most likely a problem with the battery I have, not with the line in general.

I installed a 32GB SSD instead of the default 160GB HDD. It's running smoothly so far, and since this is mainly a coding laptop, I have no problems with the smaller space.

I installed Linux Mint on it (pretty easy on the eyes), completely wiping Windows. I normally SSH into my VPS, hosted with Rackspace, to code, then push to GitHub. If I'm going to be offline, however, I pull from my server, code locally, then push to both when I get back online.

In a few months I'll post again with an update, but for now it's working swell. I love my desktop theme!
