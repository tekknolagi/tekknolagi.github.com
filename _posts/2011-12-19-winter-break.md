I'm documenting our trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Patagonia, Argentina. We'll be traveling with our close friends, the Kleins. I cut off the post since it has a lot of pictures and text; it now won't hog bandwidth on load.

**DAY 0**
Our flight down to Buenos Aires went like this:



	
  1. Leave at 11:30AM

	
  2. Wait until plane leaves at 2PM

	
  3. Fly to Dallas, Texas

	
  4. 1.5 hour layover

	
  5. 2.5 hour delay, waiting on the plane

	
  6. 10.5 hour flight

	
  7. Wake up in Buenos Aires, Argentina


Did I mention that in San Jose airport (where we left) a man sprinted through security without being checked? The TSA tracked him down with their surveillance system, and temporarily shut down all outbound flights. Craziness.

**DAY 1**
After finally getting to the hotel at around 2PM, we walked around and found a small market in Recoleta. 'Twas lovely place! There was a band playing, and people were dancing and singing along.

Our choice restaurant for dinner (dubbed _Fervor_) had one vegetarian option. It was a rather dull pasta.

Removed, see gallery.

During dinner, my dad developed a feeling that the party of 14 at the table next to us was from Long Island, New York. After about 40 minutes of deliberation about who would get up and ask them, my little brother did. They were from LA and jokingly took offense.

**DAY 2**
We awoke at noon, as Buenos Aires is five hours ahead of Palo Alto. For lunch, we walked to _Cafe Tortoni_, the oldest coffee shop in the whole of Argentina. It was established in 1858.

Removed, see gallery.

After more walking by the river, we saw a fabulous bridge, dubbed _La Mujer_:

Removed, see gallery.

We're having dinner at a very local steakhouse called _La Brigada_, which is soccer themed. <del>I shudder at the thought of their vegetarian options.</del> Their ravioli was lovely, and the rest of the family (even my father) had different cuts of beef, and loved it.

Removed, see gallery.

**DAY 3**

After a wakeup at 10AM, we strolled to a cafe called _La Biela_. We had coffee and toast; we were 
not particularly hungry.

Removed, see gallery.

A man dressed as a clown was playing a melancholy tune on an accordion. We heard that the cemetery was beautiful, and it was. We happened to accidentally walk in as a procession was going through... 'Twas a bit awkward. We then took the subway across town to explore. After an hour and a half of heat and awesome shops, we took two cabs back to the hotel for a nap.

**Day 4**
After a 3.5 hour flight to El Calafate, we drove through the small town, and to the middle of nowhere. We stayed at a tiny hotel called _Los Notros_. We had a very long lunch (apparently that's how it's done in Patagonia...) and then napped.

We took a walk down a path to get close to the _Perito Moreno Glacier_.  We saw some glacier calving. Calving is when chunks of ice fall off of a glacier.We showered, had some more ravioli, and went to bed. The couple next door loved each other a lot, and made that clear to all the adjacent rooms. My golly, it was loud.

**Day 5**
We woke up really early to get all bundled up and onto the boat to the Perito Moreno Glacier that we had seen the previous day. After a short but bumpy van ride to the dock, we hopped on and watched icebergs float by. We walked through the trees then across a beach before putting our crampons on. Without them, we'd be totally helpless on the glacier.

Back at the hotel, we had a two hour lunch (a recurring theme here) and then took a van out to this farm in the middle of nowhere. I went fishing with Ben, caught no fish, then built some rafts out of wood.

The rest of that day was shockingly uneventful.

**Day 6**
In the morning, we packed everything for a four hour van ride to the next hotel, and almost forgot three bags. Typical.

We passed through _El Calafate_, a small mountain town, only stopping to switch vans to get to the _Los Cerros_, the next hotel. We picked up a mother and her daughter, then they realized 10 minutes into the trip that they'd forgotten to pick up their dad/husband from the hotel! He thought it was worth a chuckle when we found him.

They were from Switzerland, and the girl's mom spoke eight languages: French, Spanish, English, Swiss German, ... and some others.

On the way, we learned that the wind gets up to 160 kph, but normally hovers around 100. It makes driving hard sometimes.

After arriving, we spoke to our guide for the next two days, Pedro. He was very animated! He spoke of the ice cap in Argentina and Chile, and how it is the third biggest in the world, next to Greenland and Antarctica.

**Day 7**
We awoke early for a 13 mile hike through the hills and to the base of the glacier on Mount Fitz Roy. There was a beautiful bright blue (and ice cold) lake, and we filled up our bottles. We hiked back to town and got to the hotel at around eight.

We slept well.

**Day 8**
Emma and Michael left for another hike (12 miles), and everyone but my mom, dad, and Ben left for a short walk to a waterfall. We stayed for two hours, and played around in the water.

We came back, had some wonderful ice cream (berry-flavoured and hand made), imported some photos (below) and then had dinner at _El Ritual del Fuego_. We met the chef earlier that day on the walk.

**Day 9**
This morning we did some more glacier hiking, but on a different glacier. Eduardo and Caesar guided us among the towering ice peaks and crevasses.

After the hike, we had lunch on the rocks (just cheese&arugula; sandwiches, but they were delicious) and returned to the hotel. <del>I think we're getting waffles for dinner tonight.</del> We had tomato soup and fettuccine for dinner, and went to bed before when they normally start serving food.

**Day 10**
We left Los Cerros, and drove 8 hours to a remote part in Chile; the nearest village was two hours away. We stayed in Patagonia Camp, a collection of yurts! For those of you unfamiliar with yurts, they look like this:

We hiked some more, on the right hand side of a 4 day trail called the "w" for its shape around the peaks in the park.

**Day 11**
We had a more relaxed day, walked to a waterfall near the Camp, and then evacuated the Camp the next morning.

Though we knew of the wildfire in the area, it was only that day that it was so close. We drove 4 hours to Punta Arenas, Chile, and saw some penguins. The fire is still getting worse.

Took a 4 hour flight to Santiago, from there to Dallas, and then to SFO. It's good to be back home!
