Palo Alto's Henry M. Gunn High School is hosting a hackathon open to PAUSD students! It will take place on April 21, 2013, and will take place at Gunn.

All high school programmers in Palo Alto should definitely come and see what it's all about - there will be free food, drinks, coffee, and good music.

The signup sheet can be found at [this Google Form](http://goo.gl/9z3vG).

See you there!

Update: It went swimmingly. [Here](http://photos.bernsteinbear.com/post/52445522971) are some photos!
