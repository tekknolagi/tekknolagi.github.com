It is given that brownies complement cookies, and that 
    
    cos(brownies) = happiness



Therefore,


    
    brownies = acos(happiness)



(a cos of happiness)

So:


    
    90-brownies = asin(happiness)
    
    cookies = asin(happiness)



(a sin of happiness)

Also,


    
    atan(happiness) = cookies/brownies = peppermint bark



Conclusion? **Math is delicious.**
