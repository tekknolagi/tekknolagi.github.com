Inline caching is a popular technique for optimizing dynamic language runtimes.
The idea comes from the 1984 paper [*Efficient implementation of the
Smalltalk-80 system*][smalltalk] (PDF) by L. Peter Deutsch and Allan M.
Schiffman. I have written about it before ([Inline
caching](/blog/inline-caching/) and [Inline caching:
quickening](/blog/inline-caching-quickening/)), using a tiny sample
interpreter.

[smalltalk]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800017.800542

While this tiny interpreter is good for illustrating the core technique, it
does not have any real-world requirements or complexity: its object model
models nothing of interest; the types are immutable; and there is no way to
program for this interpreter using a text programming language. The result is
somewhat unsatisfying.

In this post, I will write about the inline caching implementation in
[Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison), a relatively complete
Python 3.8 runtime originally developed for use in Instagram. It nicely
showcases all of the fun and sharp edges of the Python object model and how we
solved hard problems.

In order to better illustrate the design choices we made when building
Skybison, I will often side-by-side it with a version of CPython, the most
popular implementation of Python. This is not meant to degrade CPython; CPython
is the reference implementation, it is extremely widely used, and it is still
being actively developed. In fact, later (3.11+) versions of CPython use
similar techniques to those shown here.

## Optimization decisions

This post will talk about the inline caching system and in the process
potentially mention a host of performance features built in to Skybison. They
work *really well together* but ultimately they are orthogonal features and
should not be conflated. Some of these ideas are:

* Immediate objects
* Compact objects
* Layouts (also called "hidden classes" or "object shapes" in other runtimes)
* Inline caching and cache invalidation
* Quickening
* Assembly interpreter
* A template just-in-time (JIT) compiler

For example, a lot of the inline caching infrastructure is made much more
efficient *because* we have compact objects and layouts. And quickening reduces
the number of comparisons about what cache state we are in. And the assembly
interpreter makes inline caching even faster. And the JIT makes it faster
still.

We will focus on inline caching of attribute loads for now.

## Loading attributes

Python has a notion of object attributes and loading attributes looks like
this:

```python
def fn(obj):
  return obj.some_attribute
```

The object `obj` is on the left hand side and the attribute name
`some_attribute` is on the right hand side. Because Python is a very dynamic
language, over the lifetime of the function `fn`, `obj` can be any type. So the
bytecode compiler for CPython emits a `LOAD_ATTR` opcode and calls it a day. No
sense trying to wrangle the code into something more specific using static
analysis.

The path for attribute lookups in CPython involves some generic dictionary
lookups and function calls. We can take a look at the opcode handler for
`LOAD_ATTR` in CPython and some of the library functions it uses to see what I
mean:

```c
TARGET(LOAD_ATTR) {
    PyObject *name = GETITEM(names, oparg);
    PyObject *owner = TOP();
    PyObject *res = PyObject_GetAttr(owner, name);
    Py_DECREF(owner);
    SET_TOP(res);
    if (res == NULL)
        goto error;
    DISPATCH();
}
```

The opcode handler fetches the top of the stack (the "owner" in CPython and
"receiver" in Skybison and a lot of Smalltalk-inspired runtimes, but the
important thing is that it's the left hand side of the `.`), reads the string
object name from a tuple on the code object, and passes them to
`PyObject_GetAttr`.

`PyObject_GetAttr` does the required dispatch for an attribute lookup. It first
ensures the attribute is a string, inspects the type of the receiver `v`, and
calls the appropriate dictionary lookup function.

```c
PyObject *
PyObject_GetAttr(PyObject *v, PyObject *name)
{
    PyTypeObject *tp = Py_TYPE(v);

    if (!PyUnicode_Check(name)) {
        PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                     "attribute name must be string, not '%.200s'",
                     name->ob_type->tp_name);
        return NULL;
    }
    if (tp->tp_getattro != NULL)
        return (*tp->tp_getattro)(v, name);
    if (tp->tp_getattr != NULL) {
        char *name_str = PyUnicode_AsUTF8(name);
        if (name_str == NULL)
            return NULL;
        return (*tp->tp_getattr)(v, name_str);
    }
    PyErr_Format(PyExc_AttributeError,
                 "'%.50s' object has no attribute '%U'",
                 tp->tp_name, name);
    return NULL;
}
```

The normal `tp_getattr` slot is a generic function like
`PyObject_GenericGetAttr` that reads from the dictionary on the type, figures
out what offset the attribute is, checks if it is a descriptor, and so on and
so forth. This is a *lot* of work.

`PyObject_GetAttr` is meant to be the entrypoint for most (all?) attribute
lookups in CPython, so it has to handle every case. In the common
case---attribute lookups in the interpreter with `LOAD_ATTR`---it's doing too
much. One small example of this is the `PyUnicode_Check`. We know in the
interpreter that the attribute name will always be a string! Why check again?

Skybison also has a very generic `LOAD_ATTR` handler but it is only used if
a function's bytecode cannot be optimized. I have reproduced it here for
reference so that you can see how similar it is to CPython's:

```cpp
HANDLER_INLINE Continue Interpreter::doLoadAttr(Thread* thread, word arg) {
  Frame* frame = thread->currentFrame();
  HandleScope scope(thread);
  Object receiver(&scope, thread->stackTop());
  Tuple names(&scope, Code::cast(frame->code()).names());
  Str name(&scope, names.at(arg));
  RawObject result = thread->runtime()->attributeAt(thread, receiver, name);
  if (result.isErrorException()) return Continue::UNWIND;
  thread->stackSetTop(result);
  return Continue::NEXT;
}
```

The more common case in Skybison is a cached attribute lookup. If you have read
my mini-series on inline caching in the made-up interpreter, you will know that
I encoded a state machine in the opcode handlers for method lookup: the
uncached opcode handler transitioned to either a caching version once it saw
its first objects. Skybison does something similar, but it does it better.

Skybison starts with `LOAD_ATTR_ANAMORPHIC`: the state that has seen no
objects. When it is first executed, it does a full attribute
lookup---dictionaries and all---and then caches the result if possible.

```cpp
HANDLER_INLINE Continue Interpreter::doLoadAttrAnamorphic(Thread* thread,
                                                          word arg) {
  word cache = currentCacheIndex(thread->currentFrame());
  return loadAttrUpdateCache(thread, arg, cache);
}
```

Depending on the type of the receiver and the type of the attribute value that was
found on the object (yes, this is important!), we rewrite the current opcode to
something more specialized. I have annotated `loadAttrUpdateCache`:

```cpp
Continue Interpreter::loadAttrUpdateCache(Thread* thread, word arg,
                                          word cache) {
  HandleScope scope(thread);
  Frame* frame = thread->currentFrame();
  Function function(&scope, frame->function());
  // ...
  Object receiver(&scope, thread->stackTop());
  Str name(&scope, Tuple::cast(Code::cast(frame->code()).names()).at(arg));

  Object location(&scope, NoneType::object());
  LoadAttrKind kind;
  // Do the full attribute lookup. Attribute kind, if applicable, is stored in
  // `kind` and and location information, if applicable, is stored in
  // `location`.
  Object result(&scope, thread->runtime()->attributeAtSetLocation(
                            thread, receiver, name, &kind, &location));
  // The attribute might not exist or execution of the attribute lookup might
  // have raised an exception; attribute lookups can execute arbitrary code.
  if (result.isErrorException()) return Continue::UNWIND;
  if (location.isNoneType()) {
    // We can't cache this looup for some reason.
    thread->stackSetTop(*result);
    return Continue::NEXT;
  }

  // Cache the attribute load.
  MutableTuple caches(&scope, frame->caches());
  ICState ic_state = icCurrentState(*caches, cache);
  Function dependent(&scope, frame->function());
  LayoutId receiver_layout_id = receiver.layoutId();
  if (ic_state == ICState::kAnamorphic) {
    switch (kind) {
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceOffset:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceFunction:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_TYPE_BOUND_METHOD);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceProperty:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_PROPERTY);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceSlotDescr:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_SLOT_DESCR);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceType:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_TYPE);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceTypeDescr:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_TYPE_DESCR);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kModule: {
        ValueCell value_cell(&scope, *location);
        DCHECK(location.isValueCell(), "location must be ValueCell");
        icUpdateAttrModule(thread, caches, cache, receiver, value_cell,
                           dependent);
      } break;
      case LoadAttrKind::kType:
        icUpdateAttrType(thread, caches, cache, receiver, name, location,
                         dependent);
        break;
      default:
        UNREACHABLE("kinds should have been handled before");
    }
  } else {
    // ...
  }
  thread->stackSetTop(*result);
  return Continue::NEXT;
}
```

Then we never see the opcode handler for `LOAD_ATTR_ANAMORPHIC` again! The
opcode has monomorphic specialization: it has been specialized for the one type
it has seen.

We have also stored the receiver's layout ID and attribute offset in the cache
with `icUpdateAttr`. `icUpdateAttr` handles writing to the cache, including
both the write to the cache tuple and registering dependencies---which we'll
talk about later.

For now, we'll take a tour through the monomorphic attribute handler.

### Monomorphic

There is a lot going on here but a very common case is a field on an object,
like the below Python code, so we will focus on that:

```python
class C:
  def __init__(self):
    self.value = 5

def lookup_value(obj):
  return obj.value

# First: anamorphic -> monomorphic
lookup_value(C())
# Second: monomorphic!
lookup_value(C())
```

This case is the `LoadAttrKind::kInstanceOffset` case. We have a special opcode
to handle this: `LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE`.

```cpp
HANDLER_INLINE Continue Interpreter::doLoadAttrInstance(Thread* thread,
                                                        word arg) {
  Frame* frame = thread->currentFrame();
  word cache = currentCacheIndex(frame);
  RawMutableTuple caches = MutableTuple::cast(frame->caches());
  RawObject receiver = thread->stackTop();
  bool is_found;
  RawObject cached =
      icLookupMonomorphic(caches, cache, receiver.layoutId(), &is_found);
  if (!is_found) {
    EVENT_CACHE(LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE);
    return Interpreter::loadAttrUpdateCache(thread, arg, cache);
  }
  RawObject result = loadAttrWithLocation(thread, receiver, cached);
  thread->stackSetTop(result);
  return Continue::NEXT;
}
```

This opcode handler does much less than the generic version. It does a
monomorphic lookup (a load and compare) and then a load from the receiver. If
the types don't match then we do another full lookup and transition to a
polymorphic (multiple types) opcode, which we'll look at in the next section.

```cpp
inline RawObject icLookupMonomorphic(RawMutableTuple caches, word cache,
                                     LayoutId layout_id, bool* is_found) {
  word index = cache * kIcPointersPerEntry;
  DCHECK(!caches.at(index + kIcEntryKeyOffset).isUnbound(),
         "cache.at(index) is expected to be monomorphic");
  RawSmallInt key = SmallInt::fromWord(static_cast<word>(layout_id));
  if (caches.at(index + kIcEntryKeyOffset) == key) {
    *is_found = true;
    return caches.at(index + kIcEntryValueOffset);
  }
  *is_found = false;
  return Error::notFound();
}
```

This looks like a lot of code still but it actually only takes a few machine
instructions in the fast path. When optimized by a C++ compiler, this function
does:

* A memory load from the frame to get the cache index
* A memory load from the frame to get the caches tuple
* A memory load from the stack to get the receiver
* A memory load from the receiver (if it's a heap object) to get its layout ID
* A memory load from the caches tuple to get the stored layout ID
* A comparison with the receiver layout ID to see if they are the same
* A memory load from the caches tuple to get the cached attribute offset
* A memory load from the receiver to get the cached attribute
* A memory store to the stack to push the result

Now, you may say that that is a lot of loads---and it kind of is---but it is
still fewer instruction and loads than the slot-based function call and
multiple dictionary lookup dispatch that we would otherwise require for an
uncached lookup.

This could probably still be reduced further by hand, which we have done in our
[assembly implementation][asm-load-attr-instance] of the Python interpreter. In
a compiled representation of this cache, we could eliminate the loads required
for cache index, cache tuple, receiver, stored layout ID, and cached attribute
offset---they would all be encoded directly into the machine code.

[asm-load-attr-instance]: https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/blob/9253d1e0e42c756dfa37e709918266e09e1d15dc/runtime/interpreter-gen-x64.cpp#L1130

Additionally, the assembly interpreter uses the system stack (`rsp`) so pushes
and pops are much cheaper and have their own instructions: the familiar x86
`push` and `pop`.

But what about the slow path? What if we are seeing a different type this time
around? Well, it's morphin' time. Let's transition to the polymorphic cache in
`loadAttrUpdateCache`:

```cpp
Continue Interpreter::loadAttrUpdateCache(Thread* thread, word arg,
                                          word cache) {
  // ... full attribute lookup here ...

  // Cache the attribute load
  MutableTuple caches(&scope, frame->caches());
  ICState ic_state = icCurrentState(*caches, cache);
  Function dependent(&scope, frame->function());
  LayoutId receiver_layout_id = receiver.layoutId();
  if (ic_state == ICState::kAnamorphic) {
    // ...
  } else {
    DCHECK(
        currentBytecode(thread) == LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE ||
            currentBytecode(thread) == LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_TYPE_BOUND_METHOD ||
            currentBytecode(thread) == LOAD_ATTR_POLYMORPHIC,
        "unexpected opcode");
    switch (kind) {
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceOffset:
      case LoadAttrKind::kInstanceFunction:
        rewriteCurrentBytecode(frame, LOAD_ATTR_POLYMORPHIC);
        icUpdateAttr(thread, caches, cache, receiver_layout_id, location, name,
                     dependent);
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  }
  thread->stackSetTop(*result);
  return Continue::NEXT;
}
```

We transition from `LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE` to `LOAD_ATTR_POLYMORPHIC` and also
(with `icUpdateAttr`) transition the cache from a monomorphic cache (key+value)
to a polymorphic cache (tuple of multiple key+value).

### Polymorphic

The polymorphic attribute lookup is the common transition target of several
different monomorphic *instance* lookups---the ones that only store field
offsets. It is different from the monomorphic lookups in that it has to check
against multiple stored layout IDs, so we do not further specialize the
polymorphic case into instance vs type bound method cases.

```cpp
HANDLER_INLINE Continue Interpreter::doLoadAttrPolymorphic(Thread* thread,
                                                           word arg) {
  Frame* frame = thread->currentFrame();
  RawObject receiver = thread->stackTop();
  LayoutId layout_id = receiver.layoutId();
  word cache = currentCacheIndex(frame);
  bool is_found;
  RawObject cached = icLookupPolymorphic(MutableTuple::cast(frame->caches()),
                                         cache, layout_id, &is_found);
  if (!is_found) {
    EVENT_CACHE(LOAD_ATTR_POLYMORPHIC);
    return loadAttrUpdateCache(thread, arg, cache);
  }
  RawObject result = loadAttrWithLocation(thread, receiver, cached);
  thread->stackSetTop(result);
  return Continue::NEXT;
}
```

The function `icLookupPolymorphic` is similar in structure to its monomorphic
sibling except that it loops over all of the stored layout IDs to check.

```cpp
inline RawObject icLookupPolymorphic(RawMutableTuple caches, word cache,
                                     LayoutId layout_id, bool* is_found) {
  word index = cache * kIcPointersPerEntry;
  DCHECK(caches.at(index + kIcEntryKeyOffset).isUnbound(),
         "cache.at(index) is expected to be polymorphic");
  RawSmallInt key = SmallInt::fromWord(static_cast<word>(layout_id));
  caches = MutableTuple::cast(caches.at(index + kIcEntryValueOffset));
  for (word j = 0; j < kIcPointersPerPolyCache; j += kIcPointersPerEntry) {
    if (caches.at(j + kIcEntryKeyOffset) == key) {
      *is_found = true;
      return caches.at(j + kIcEntryValueOffset);
    }
  }
  *is_found = false;
  return Error::notFound();
}
```

The fast path is similar: find the cached offset, load from the receiver, and
get out. The slow path requires a full lookup and updating the cache.

There is one detail that is important here that I glossed over in the
`LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE` handler. `loadAttrWithLocation` is not *just* a wrapper
for a simple field load. It also handles the Python object model logic for
binding methods.

When an object has a function as an attribute on *the object's type*, the
function must be wrapped together with the object as a "bound method." When it
is just an attribute on the instance, it must not be wrapped. See, for example:

```python
class C:
    def f(self):
        return 1


def g(self):
    return 2


obj = C(g)
print(obj.f)  # <bound method C.f of <__main__.C object at 0x7ff922f3fa90>>
obj.g = g
print(obj.g)  # <function g at 0x7ff923019e18>
```

So `loadAttrWithLocation` is used only in the instance case and handles the
bound method allocation if need be. It also deals with the split between
in-object attributes and overflow attributes---which are an implementation
detail of our object layout system.

```cpp
HANDLER_INLINE USED RawObject Interpreter::loadAttrWithLocation(
    Thread* thread, RawObject receiver, RawObject location) {
  if (location.isFunction()) {
    HandleScope scope(thread);
    Object self(&scope, receiver);
    Object function(&scope, location);
    return thread->runtime()->newBoundMethod(function, self);
  }

  word offset = SmallInt::cast(location).value();

  DCHECK(receiver.isHeapObject(), "expected heap object");
  RawInstance instance = Instance::cast(receiver);
  if (offset >= 0) {
    return instance.instanceVariableAt(offset);
  }

  // ... handle overflow attributes ...
}
```

This caching system that we've looked at so far is pretty straightforward when
types are immutable. If the receiver is a different type than we expect, we
update the cache. But what if types themselves could chnage?

## Modifying types

As it turns out, that is the world we live in: in Python, most types are like
any other object and are mutable. Any ordinary user code can change the
attributes, methods, and other metadata about types.

For example, here we add a property to a type after it is created:

```python
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 5


obj = C()
print(obj.value)  # 5
C.value = property(lambda self: 100)
print(obj.value)  # 100
```

Just setting `C.value = 100` would not cause `obj.value` to change. It is the
`__get__` method on `property` that takes precedence over "normal" attribute
lookups. Nowhere in our fast-path attribute read code does this get handled. We
don't check that the type is the same. Checking that the type is the same the
naive way would involve walking up the entire method resolution order (MRO) and
checking if *every single type* was the same as we expected. Slow. Instead, we
invalidate our assumptions on *writes*.[^pypy-versions]

[^pypy-versions]: We do this by eagerly invalidating the fast-path code when
    the type changes but some runtimes, like PyPy, have a version check in the
    fast path. Then on the slow path, they just bump the versions of all the
    relevant types in the hierarchy.

I mentioned "dependencies" briefly earlier. There is some code in
`icUpdateAttr` that registers the function containing the cache as "dependent"
on the type of the receiver. Then, when something makes a change to a given
type, we go an invalidate all of its dependent caches *and* the dependents of
types in its inheritance hierarchy.

We can do this extremely slow operation when types change because we expect
attribute lookups to be frequent and changes to types *after they are used* to
be very rare.

Looking at the dependency invalidation code is really neat because it is the
"Maxwell's Equations" (not me---the physics guy) of the Python type system.
Take a look at [runtime/ic.h][ic.h] and [runtime/ic.cpp][ic.cpp] for a deep dive.

## Other things to go explore

We have our layout system in [`runtime/layout.h`][layout_h] and
[`runtime/runtime.cpp`][runtime_cpp]. This showcases the thin veneer on top of
type objects that we use to track where attributes are on different types of
objects. In Skybison this is called "layouts" but in other systems it is called
"hidden classes", "object shapes", and probably some other names.

[layout_h]: https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/blob/9253d1e0e42c756dfa37e709918266e09e1d15dc/runtime/layout.h

We have our assembly interpreter (interpreter written in assembly; called
"template interpreter" by the JVM folks) and template JIT compiler in
[`runtime/interpreter-gen-x64.cpp`][interpreter_gen].

[interpreter_gen]: https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison/blob/9253d1e0e42c756dfa37e709918266e09e1d15dc/runtime/interpreter-gen-x64.cpp

The JIT compiler we are building *on top of CPython* called
[Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), which you can play with
at [trycinder.com](https://trycinder.com/).

The rest of the [excellent resources](/pl-resources/#runtime-optimization)
(written mostly by other people) on runtime optimization. There are a bunch
that touch on inline caching and hidden classes. I think the one that made it
click for me was [An Inline Cache Isn't Just A
Cache](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2018/6/5/an-inline-cache-isnt-just-a-cache)
by Matthew Gaudet.

## Thanks

Thank you to all of the many people who wrote great language runtimes, people
who preceded me on the team, and people who I worked with on the team. You came
up with most of the ideas. I just chronicle them here.
