Hey guys!

I was at the FIRST regional in Sacramento with the rest of Team 8, and we had a great idea. Freddy, Marten, Danny and I want to create a Meshnet in Palo Alto.

Our setup currently requires at least a router and some computer in a weatherproofed box outside a house. We thought a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (model B) wired to a [D-LINK](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=router&hl=en&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=16929312685474719279&sa=X&ei=MhVmT4ykMaGUiQLSuNyiDw&ved=0CKkBEPICMAA) inside a Tupperware container would make for a cheap and effective model.

The Raspberry Pi would run CJDNS as both client and server, and would autoconnect and automatically pair with the other units. The router would simply make the network.

Ideally, we would have a power cord coming out of that (weatherproofed hole) and into an outdoor outlet. If we're to make this rugged, the contents of the container would be secured, and then we'd duct tape exterior. If possible, we'd include a WiFi extender.

The total cost for one unit is around $100, and it broadcasts a wireless network. The simplest way to take part is to join this wireless network, and set up CJDNS on that computer. Hopefully this will be automated.

The idea is to make this Apple-simple.

As far as robotics...

We went out in a blaze of glory. Even though we didn't win, we lost a match by being physically shoved out of the arena.

We'll do much better at SVR!
