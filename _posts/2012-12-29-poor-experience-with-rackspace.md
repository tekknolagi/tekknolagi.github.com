_Before you read this post, please note that I do write and host most of my code on a Rackspace VPS, and in fact am writing this in a remote emacs session._

On to the story.

My cousin Rafi asked me to help him set up a private Minecraft server so he and his friends could play alone.

I, of course, defaulted to my then-favorite VPS provider: Rackspace. I created an account for him with my email address (so I could handle the tech stuff), his mom entered her credit card, and then we finished making the account.

I spun up a Debian 6 64bit server, downloaded the server .jar, and ran it in a tmux session. We ate dinner.

45 minutes later, we tried to connect - but it was offline. Funny. I tried to SSH in, but to no avail - connection timeout. I attempted to log into the control panel... that's weird. Username/password combination unrecognized.

I tried for about 15 minutes... nope. Odd. I logged into my personal account and chatted support, gave them the other account details, everything needed to prove that I was the owner of the account.

The kind support representative told me that Rackspace had billing trouble with my account, helped me fix it and pay the invoice, but told me he could not bring back the suspended account from the dead.

I had to leave from my cousin's house from the night, so I told him I'd try and set it up again later.

A month passed, and we were in an Apple store in Scottsdale, Arizona. We tried setting up again, but within two minutes we got an email saying that the account did not get approved. How strange.

I tried again, but with the same result. To be clear, I tried with a different email address, username, password, credit card, and security question.

I Googled about this situation, but found nothing.

I called up the number mentioned in the notification email, gave them my identifying information, and was transferred to a different representative.

He looked up the account, found that it was suspended, and told me so. I asked why, and he said that he could not tell me that. I asked why he couldn't tell me, and he hung up on me.

Now I don't believe that all Rackspace employees are like that particular disgruntled dude, but for me, that doesn't fit their promise of "fanatical support."

The several unnecessary hours I spent trying to make Rackspace work just were _not_ worth my time - and so we chose Linode.

Linode so far has been absolutely fantastic, after the slightly unintuitive OS deployment and control panel.

In conclusion... well, I don't know, really. I've never been hung up on by a customer service rep before, even the time when I was on the phone with Belkin for 6 hours. On the other hand, every other time I've used Rackspace it's been mindblowingly amazing.
