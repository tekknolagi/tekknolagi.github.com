# Preamble

By ancient rites, this code is bound,
No mortal hand may twist it 'round.

# Terms of Use

Permission granted: to mend and make,
To copy, share, for spirit's sake.
Yet mark: no coin, no profit gained,
Shall taint this magic, unrestrained.

# Disclaimer

Provided "as is," without a truth,
No crone will blame, if ill, forsooth.

# Enforcement

The pact by moonlight, strongly spun,
Binds souls if greed hath now been won.

# Cost

The threads are spun, the spell complete,
No greed, lest curses, you shall meet.
