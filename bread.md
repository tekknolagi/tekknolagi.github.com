I like making bread. This page has some simplified recipes for different tasty
breads. It's mostly a reference for myself because sometimes I forget the
ratios, and many a website will list ingredients by volume (see below for why
this matters). Maybe some day I will post pictures and more detail. Until then,
you can enjoy my [bread
journey](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi/status/1201209094259888128) on Twitter
([thread reader](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1201209094259888128) if you
would rather not open Twitter).

This page does *not* aim to be a complete baking instruction manual. I
recommend checking out a couple of other instructive recipe pages like [this
one][ka] first.

## Notes
{:.no_toc}

All the percentages on this page are in terms of mass, not volume. Mass and
volume are interchangeable for things like water, which are not very
compressible, but not for ingredients like flour.

You may notice that the percentages do not add up to 100%. This is expected;
they are percentages of the total flour in the recipe, not the total dough. For
a recipe that says "100% flour" and "80% water", you can pick 1000g of flour
and 800g of water. If it says "80% wheat" and "20% white" then the two flours
together add up to 100% of the total flour.

Water is variable in all of the following recipes. I prefer handling high
hydration dough, so I use 80% water.

## White loaf

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
White flour         100 %
Water                80 %
Salt                  2 %
Yeast                 1 %
           OR
Sourdough levain     20 %
```

Bake 1 hour at 450F. After 45 minutes, remove lid[^old-instructions].

Optionally, soak some oats (or other seeds and grains) in water for an hour and
spread them on the top of the bread right before baking. The water soak keeps
them from burning.

[^old-instructions]: This used to say "after 20 minutes, remove lid" because
    that's how I did it. But apparently I have been doing this wrong for years
    because I misread the King Arthur website *one time*. Keeping the lid on
    longer produces more steam and may give your bread more lift/fluff. We'll
    see how my new breads develop.

I like [King Arthur's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmxDKuGLWuE) videos on
shaping and pretty much everything else.

## White/wheat loaf

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
White flour          80 %
Wheat flour          20 %
Water                80 %
Salt                  2 %
Yeast                 1 %
           OR
Sourdough levain     20 %
```

Bake 1 hour at 450F. After 45 minutes, remove lid.

## Focaccia

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
White flour         100 %
Water                80 %
Olive oil             8 %
Salt                  2 %
Yeast                 1 %
```

Mix dough until minimal flour is visible and there are no major clumps. Place
your dough tub, covered, in a warm environment, like an oven with the light on
or an Instant Pot set to 80F on sous vide mode. Set a two hour timer.

Let sit for 15 minutes. Stretch and fold with wet hands. Let sit for 15
minutes. Stretch and fold with wet hands. Let sit for the rest of the duration.
The dough should have gotten pretty big and puffy.

Rub olive oil on internal surfaces of pan. Olive oil your hands. Delicately
transfer dough from tub to pan. Rub olive oil into the top of the dough blob.
Let relax for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 425F. Gently stretch and poke dough
to fit dimensions of pan.

Additional water, olive oil, salt, and herbs required for topping. Let it relax
further while the oven preheats. Bake 35 minutes.

I like how [this man from Genoa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEKzIshoYiM)
makes his focaccia. I learned a lot from his shaping and poking and dressing.

## Ciabatta

Percentages are in terms of total flour *in each subcomponent*. I haven't
figured out an understandable way to convey this, so I included an "Example"
column to disambiguate.

```
Ingredient       Quantity   Example
----------       --------   -------
BIGA
  White flour       100 %     225 g
  Water              75 %     170 g
  Yeast             0.1 %   1/8 tsp
DOUGH
  Biga              175 %     395 g
  White flour       100 %     225 g
  Water              75 %     170 g
  Salt                2 %       9 g
  Yeast               1 %       3 g
```

Make biga overnight. Combine with dough in the morning. Stretch and fold once
or twice. Don't shape. Gently transfer to counter or floured pan to prove a
little bit. Bake 25 minutes at 425F.

See the [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/rustic-italian-ciabatta-recipe)
recipe and [pro formulas](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/formulas/ciabatta).
They differ a little bit in their hydation but that's fine.

Also make sure to watch [Martin and his kid bake this](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/videos/martin-bakes-at-home/rustic-italian-ciabatta).

## Mostly rye sandwich loaf

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
Rye flour            85 %
White flour          15 %
Water                80 %
Honey                 8 %    (as needed)
Salt                  2 %
Yeast                 1 %
```

Stretch and fold as usual, but don't shape. Instead, pat it down into a
rectangular baking pan. Brush the top with honey. Bake 1 hour at 450F.

## Dinner rolls

See [white/wheat loaf](#whitewheat-loaf). Oil a large pan or baking sheet.
Shape dough into equal-sized tiny boules. Arrange on the pan. Prove 20 minutes.
Bake 30 minutes at 325F.

## Sufganiyot

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
AP flour            100 %
White sugar          20 %
Water                35 %
Vegetable oil        12 %    (1/4 cup)
Vanilla extract     2.6 %    (1 tbsp)
Eggs                 2 ct
Salt                  2 %
Yeast               1.5 %
```

Mix dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients. Stretch, fold, and rest until
doubled. Roll to 1/2 inches thick. Cut out circles. Prove. Fry 90 seconds/side.
Fill. Celebrate.

## Blueberry scones

For eight (8) sizeable scones, use ~240g flour. This requires a little less
than a small carton of blueberries.

```
Ingredient       Quantity
----------       --------
AP flour            100 %
Salt              1/2 tsp
Granulated sugar     21 %
Baking powder         5 %
Cold butter          35 %
Eggs                 2 ct
Yogurt               24 %
Vanilla extract     1 tsp
Fresh blueberries    59 %
```

Mix dry ingredients. Chop butter into chunks. Add butter to flour. Mix wet
ingredients (including blueberries). Incorporate into dry ingredients. Scoop
into appropriately-sized balls on a greased baking sheet. Bake 22 minutes at
375F.

Substitute fruit as appropriate.

## Miscellaneous
{:.no_toc}

### Small tips
{:.no_toc}

It's easier to pour flour into water and mix it up than the other way around.
This helps avoid flour getting stuck on the bottom of your bowl.

### Suggested baking tools
{:.no_toc}

Not all of these are required. Some people will tell you to buy a bunch of
expensive equipment. Bake with what you have, and if you want to incrementally
improve your tools, go for it.

* Mixing bowl
* Kitchen scale, ideally accurate to 1g
* Saran wrap or equivalent, if leaving the dough in the fridge overnight to
  ferment
* Spatula or bowl scraper, for getting the dough out of the bowl
* Hands or stand mixer
* Cotton hand-towel big enough to cover the whole bowl and drape over
* A warm place (70-80F). Could be your kitchen if it’s the right temperature,
  your oven with the oven light on, your oven with a container of hot water in
  it, a proofing chamber if you are feeling particularly luxurious, ...
* Oven
* Mitts/thick towels for handling hot containers
* A container to bake in, like a cast-iron dutch oven. A baking sheet is also
  probably fine but your bread will spread out more and it will be harder to
  get a nice crust. I also don’t have experience baking bread on just a baking
  sheet. Loaf pans are great for baking loaves.

### Philosophy
{:.no_toc}

A very smart person once asked me, *"Is bread defined by its ingredients?"* I
would argue that the magic of bread is that it is more than the sum of its
component parts, and therefore is not entirely defined by its ingredients.
Timing, folding, shaping, and scoring have huge impact on the final product.
Put some love into your loaves.
