Here are some projects that are occupying some brain space and that I am keeping an eye on, in no particular order (to demonstrate that, I shuffled before publishing). Some are because they do a lot with a small amount of code/people, some are because they feel like they are poking at something very new and cool, and some are excellent learning resources.

  * this is one of the coolest projects I have seen in a while

Not quite code but presenting very cool ideas:

* Verifying your whole register allocator too hard? No problem, just [write a verifier for a given allocation](https://cfallin.org/blog/2021/03/15/cranelift-isel-3/) and abort if it fails. This also lends itself nicely to fuzzing for automatically exploring large program state spaces.
* [Copy and Patch](https://fredrikbk.com/publications/copy-and-patch.pdf) (PDF) compilation, which generates pretty fast code very quickly
  * Related: [Deegen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11469), which gives you an
    interpreter and a JIT with caching and other goodies
* [Egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io/), and more broadly egraphs, for program IRs
* [Implementing a Toy Optimizer](https://www.pypy.org/posts/2022/07/toy-optimizer.html) and [union-find](/union-find/) in general
* (To-be-written) Using Z3 to prove your static analyzer correct
  * [More Stupid Z3Py Tricks: Simple Proofs](http://www.philipzucker.com/more-stupid-z3py-tricks-simple-proofs/) is a good jumping-off point, as is [Compiling with Constraints](https://www.philipzucker.com/compile_constraints/)
* (To-be-written) From union-find to egraphs; exploring the tradeoffs
  * UPDATE: [I wrote it!](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/whats-in-an-egraph/)
* [a simple semi-space collector](https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/12/10/a-simple-semi-space-collector) explains how semi-space GCs work in ~100 lines of C
  * Note: the zero-length array member `payload` is non-standard and probably not needed
  * Note: `is_forwarded` should actually check if if the masked tag is `== 0`
* [just-in-time code generation within webassembly](https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/08/18/just-in-time-code-generation-within-webassembly) and its accompanying [wasm-jit](https://github.com/wingo/wasm-jit)
* [Regular Expression Matching: the Virtual Machine Approach](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html)
* Interaction nets and HVM
* [Make Your Self](https://marianoguerra.org/posts/make-your-self/)
* Cheney list copying / GC
    * Cheney on the MTA
* Escape analysis and dead code elimination as compile-time GC
* PGO for DCE: [tweet one](https://x.com/rui314/status/1788079197141049825) and [tweet two](https://x.com/rui314/status/1788099027889979782)
  * [github issue](https://github.com/rui314/mold/issues/958)
* Nostr, but without all the blockchain stuff

What I am working on:

* [Scrapscript](https://github.com/tekknolagi/scrapscript), an interpreter and compiler for a small functional language
* [Dr Wenowdis](https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/dr-wenowdis.pdf) (PDF), where CF Bolz-Tereick and I are working on making C extensions faster in PyPy
* A small rasterizer for my graphics class that uses [fenster](https://github.com/zserge/fenster)
* [weval](https://github.com/cfallin/weval)-ing CPython
* [Introduction to Software Development Tooling](https://bernsteinbear.com/isdt/)
