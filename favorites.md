I found this website called [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/home)
that allows you to catalog, organize, and search your library -- and many
others. The following button links to my profile.

My favorite tea is currently Stash Tea's *Double Bergamot Earl Grey*.

I took some wonderful classes while I was at Tufts. I wholeheartedly recommend
the following:

* *Internet-scale Distributed Systems* with Noah Mendelsohn, a class that
  explores how systems are designed and implemented
* *Functional Programming* with Torsten Grust, a class that dives deep into
  Haskell's type system and some FP theory
* *Programming Languages* with Kathleen Fisher, a class about building,
  proving, and comparing programming languages
* *Compilers* with Sam Guyer, a class about --- guess what? --- building
  compilers in ML
* *Security CTF* with Ming Chow, a half-credit course in which we build a
  secure device, swap with another school, and then break into theirs
* *Concurrent Programming* with Mark Sheldon, a class all about concurrency,
  multithreading, and parallel computation
* *Machine Structure &amp; Intel Assembly Programming* with Mark Sheldon, in
  which students spend around 40 hours per week writing obscene quantities of C

I like music featuring the [hammered dulcimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammered_dulcimer).
Below is a collection of music (mostly film scores) that includes at least a
little bit of hammered dulcimer in it:

* *Hary Janos* (Zoltán Kodály), where I first heard it
* Various tracks from The Grand Budapest Hotel (Alexandre Desplat), such as:
  * *Mr. Moustafa*
  * *A Prayer for Madame D*
  * *Daylight Express to Lutz*
  * ... and many more
* *Discombobulate* (Hans Zimmer), from Sherlock Holmes -- the Robert Downey Jr
  version
* *The Dragon Book* (John Powell), from How to Train Your Dragon
* Various tracks from The Man From U.N.C.L.E (Daniel Pemberton)
  * *His Name Is Napoleon Solo*
  * *Signori Toileto Italiano*
  * *Laced Drinks*
  * *Drums of War*
* *Snow Plane* (Thomas Newman), from Spectre

Thanks to [this website][cimbalom0] for linking some that were harder for me to
find (and others not included here). Also thanks to [this website][cimbalom1]
with help identifying tracks in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. As a sidebar, I would
one day also like to catalogue music that has a sort of horse
galloping/trotting feel found in *Breaking Out* (U.N.C.L.E) or *Two Mules for
Sister Sara* (Sherlock Holmes).
